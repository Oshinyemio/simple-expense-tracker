# ðŸ’° Simple Expense Tracker

A fully serverless personal expense tracker built using AWS services. Users can log and retrieve expenses through a clean and secure API. This project demonstrates a foundational serverless architecture leveraging AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Add new expenses and retrieve expense lists via API
- Serverless architecture for scalability and cost efficiency
- Data persisted in DynamoDB using `userId` as partition key (currently hardcoded)
- Frontend static site for user interaction
- Single Lambda function handling both creation and retrieval of expenses

## ðŸš€ How to Run and Deploy

### Local Testing

- The frontend is a simple static website (`frontend/index.html`) that can be opened in any browser.
- Since the frontend calls AWS APIs, backend must be deployed or you need API mocks for full local testing.

### Deploy Backend

1. Create a DynamoDB table named `Expenses` with partition key `userId`.
2. Deploy the single Lambda function (`backend/expenses.js`) to AWS Lambda.
3. Create API Gateway REST API with endpoints:
   - POST `/expenses` â†’ linked to Lambda function
   - GET `/expenses` â†’ linked to the same Lambda function (routing based on HTTP method)
4. Configure IAM roles and permissions allowing Lambda to access DynamoDB.
5. Set the environment variable `EXPENSES_TABLE` in the Lambda function to your DynamoDB table name.

### Host Frontend

- Upload contents of `frontend/` folder to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.
- Update `app.js` to point API requests to your deployed API Gateway URL.

### Notes

- Currently, `userId` is hardcoded in the frontend for demonstration purposes.
- User authentication and multi-user support will be added in the advanced version.
